The `BlockStore` maintains information about all configured chains, and serves as a directory of chains, whereas the [ChainStore] manages chain-specific data. The `BlockStore` is sharded so that each chain can use, depending on configuration, a separate database. Regardless of configuration, the data for each chain is stored in its own database namespace, though for historical reasons, the code also deals with a shared table for the block and call cache for chains in the `public` namespace."]]});
